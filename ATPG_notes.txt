ATPG_DET (RYAN)
1. Find reduced fault list
	run RFL (gives us checkpoint fault list)
2. call ATPG on each fault and build list of vectors
3. remove redundancies
4. calculate FC
	run PFS on circuit (which gives us list of faults covered by our generated vectors
	FC = (#faults in pfs fault list) / (total num of faults possible)
			tot faults = Nnodes * 2
	


ATPG (LUKE, ARPITA, and SHRYA)
1. RTG for saturation (look at phase 2 graph under RTG)
RTG but instead of n test patterns, we take difference between last and current FC
	if FC(n) - (FC(n) - FC(n-1)) - (FC(n) - FC(n-2)) < .1 exit
2.  foreach checkpoint not in fault list
	- D-ALG or PODEM for each uncovered checkpoint
	- run PFS or DFS on the checkpoints not covered (change X to 1 or 0)
		- calc new fault coverage
3. if checkpoint cannot be covered, do ATPG for fin/fout
remember to remove duplicate vectors"


CODING LIST:
1. build modified RTG that exits upon saturation (defined above)
	- use PFS for generated list
	- verify with DFS during testing
2. run D-alg or PODEM and add function to replace X with 1 or 0
3. modified FC calculation with new atpg vector
4. algorithm for fout gates (need some way to test this too)


PRESENTATION TASKS:
PART 1: MAIN GOAL
	generally outline why we need ATPG
	bring in parts if first lecture. 
	brief overview of ATPG needs in industry
PART 2: OUR APPROACH
	least amount of computational work for highest fault coverage with 
		lowest number of test vectors.
	multivariable maximization/minimization problem. (computational work/FC/#vectors)
	state machine flow chart of our ATPG
		*reference above ATPG
	What parts we used in our ATPG. 
		- explain how each part works
	Why we chose our exit conditions for each state (FC/ time??)
		balanced coverage amount with time etc.
PART 3: RESULTS
	Case 1: for small circuit (c17) we were able to get 100% fast (no need for ATPG?)
		- or only ran ATPG on checkpoints (based on sim time)
	Case 2: x3mult/add2. med size circuit 
		- had to use RTG for 5 seconds (93%) and then ATPG finished with 100% in 15 seconds
	Case 3: c1355.ckt (big boi circuit)
		- RTG ran for > 65% FC (1 minuite) and then ATPG to get to 99% after 4 minutes.
